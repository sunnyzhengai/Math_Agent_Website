name: distractor_quality
description: |
  Evaluates the quality of distractor (wrong answer) choices.
  Ensures that:
  - Distractors are plausible (not obviously wrong)
  - Distractors represent common student errors
  - Rules agent achieves reasonable accuracy (not too easy/hard)
  - Good variety in distractor types

  This eval ensures questions are educational and appropriately challenging.

thresholds:
  min_rules_accuracy: 0.60      # Rules agent should get 60%+ correct
  max_rules_accuracy: 0.85      # But not more than 85% (too easy)
  min_unique_distractors: 3     # At least 3 unique wrong answers

test_config:
  n_samples: 50                 # Test 50 questions per skill/difficulty
  seed_range: [0, 49]          # Use first 50 seeds
