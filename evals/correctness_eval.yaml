name: correctness
description: |
  Evaluates mathematical correctness of generated questions.
  Ensures that:
  - Solutions are mathematically correct
  - Distractors don't accidentally match the solution
  - No mathematical impossibilities are generated
  - Oracle agent achieves 100% accuracy

  This is a CRITICAL eval - must pass 100% for production use.

thresholds:
  min_oracle_accuracy: 1.0      # 100% required (no exceptions)
  max_duplicate_choices: 0      # No duplicate answer choices allowed
  max_solution_collisions: 0    # Solution can't match any distractor

test_config:
  n_samples: 50                 # Test 50 questions per skill/difficulty
  seed_range: [0, 49]          # Use first 50 seeds
