name: difficulty_calibration
description: Verify difficulty labels match empirical accuracy (is "hard" actually hard?)
thresholds:
  easy_target_accuracy: 0.75    # Easy questions should be 70-80% correct
  medium_target_accuracy: 0.55  # Medium questions should be 50-60% correct
  hard_target_accuracy: 0.35    # Hard questions should be 30-40% correct
  calibration_tolerance: 0.15   # Allow 15% deviation from target
note: Requires empirical student data or agent performance data
